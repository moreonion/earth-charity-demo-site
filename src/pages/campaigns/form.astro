        <h2>An action page with a form</h2>
        <p>Imagine this was a page on your main website.</p>
        <p>
            Your supporters could start filling out the form here. When they
            click the 'Add your name' button, an Impact Stack page will open
            with the form prefilled with the data from the form here.
        </p>
        <p>Feel free to try it out.</p>

        <h2>How to do it</h2>
        <p>
            Here's some basic code to get you started. Most organisations would
            need a web developer to pick this up and adapt it for your needs and
            your website technology. If you put it on your main website it would
            likely inherit a lot of the existing styling, but we'd still expect
            you to need to do some work to make sure it looked on-brand for you.
        </p>

        <div class="mt-4">
            <p>
                You would need something like this Javascript which looks for
                the form and intercepts the submission. Then it opens an Impact
                Stack page with the fields prefilled.
            </p>
            <CodeBlock
                code={FormJavascriptRaw}
                lang="javascript"
                codeTitle="Petition form Javascript"
                text="See the Petition Form Javascript Code"
            />
        </div>

        <div class="mt-4">
            <p>Then you would need some HTML for the form itself.</p>
            <CodeBlock
                code={PetitionFormHTMLRaw}
                lang="html"
                codeTitle="Petition form HTML"
                text="See the Petition Form Code"
            />
        </div>
    </section>

    <style>
        .form-container {
            max-width: 400px;
            margin: 0 auto;
        }
    </style>
</Layout>
