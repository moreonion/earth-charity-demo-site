            Earth Charity is a made-up organisation used to demonstrate <a
                href="https://impact-stack.org">Impact Stack</a
            >.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sometimes you might want to start a supporter's interaction with an
            Impact Stack form on your main website. This site has lots of demos
            of how you might do that and what that might look like.
